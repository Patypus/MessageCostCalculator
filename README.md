# Cost Calculator

Simple solution to a requirement to calculate the total cost of messages conforming to a given iterface. See `TotalCostCalculator` for this implementation. The solution is included in a unit test project for ease of running and the tests themselves can be found in TotalCostCalculatorTests.

The project can be cloned from here, or the 1.0 release can be downloaded which contains a zip of the solution.
